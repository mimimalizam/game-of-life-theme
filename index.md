Hi, thanks for the interest in [the Game of life theme](https://github.com/mimimalizam/game-of-life).

In short, this theme is breaking the rule
and visitor can interact with the Game after it has started.

However, nice people are still able to observe how initial
game evolves.

- press `e` to start and/or restart the Game
- if your eyes are a bit tired and you'd prefer to quietly read a page you can
 - type `q` to remove cells from the screen
 - type `p` to pause the Game (use `s` to resume the Game)
- type `i` to start the Insert Mode where you can create new cells
  - with a click of a mouse new cells will be randomily created around
  - if you are feeling happy, drag mouse to create some more
- press `ESC` to --- escape the Insert Mode
- use `j` and `k` to control the speed
- to change the cells' color press any additional key

Also, by default this page lists posts author has written.
